# Conversion Funnel Analysis
ðŸ“Š Analyzing the comprehensive metrics of customer interactions on our website is of paramount importance. Google Analytics proves to be invaluable in capturing these insights. By closely examining customer actions, we can readily identify pain points, areas for improvement on the website, and gain fresh ideas to attract and engage our customers.

 Two funnel charts above depict the total number of unique visitors and total visits, respectively. 'Total visitors' represents the unique individuals visiting the website, whereas 'total visits' account for all the visits made, which may not be unique as a single visitor can make multiple visits. By analyzing these charts, we can directly assess the website's footfall and understand how visitors behave during each action. It's worth noting that in the above funnel charts, the last three actions exhibit variations in their numbers.

In this funnel, the metrics vary slightly in comparison to the visitor and visit funnels. Here, our focus is on understanding customer actions after completion.

* On the first page, there were 20,000 visits, out of which Approximately 16,800 visitors submitted their information.
* Among those who submitted their information, 11,600(aprox.) completed payments.
* And from those who completed payments, 11,500(aprox.) went on to review and complete their orders."

By examining the conversion rates of visits through various mediums, it becomes evident that paid mediums such as CPC and CPM exhibit the highest conversion rates, exceeding 60%

## Funnel by Source

Most of the visitors are coming from Google, but there is a slight discrepancy in the data. To enhance the visualization, I've focused on three sources: YouTube, Facebook.com, and Yahoo. Interestingly, Yahoo stands out with a high conversion rate of 10%.
## Paid Ad comparision

In conclusion, the analysis of various metrics and data points has provided valuable insights into our website's performance, visitor behavior, and the effectiveness of our advertising efforts. We've identified strengths, such as the high conversion rate from Yahoo as a traffic source, and areas that require attention, like exit rates on the home page and YouTube. By continuing to monitor and optimize these key metrics, we can make informed decisions to enhance the user experience and maximize the impact of our investments in time and advertising.
