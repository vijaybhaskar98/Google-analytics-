## What is Google analytics?
Google Analytics stands out as a widely embraced web analytics tool, empowering users to customize and extract valuable insights from websites. With its user-friendly interface, this tool facilitates the seamless extraction and visualization of metrics from websites. It serves as an excellent resource for effortlessly deploying analytical features to existing websites, making data analysis and interpretation a streamlined process.

## Why Bigquery integration?
Google Analytics boasts a robust interface for diverse analytics needs, yet faces challenges handling complex data and intricate queries. The solution lies in seamless integration with BigQuery, a petabyte-scale data warehouse offering cost-effectiveness and user-friendly tools through Google Cloud Platform. Renowned for easy integration with visualization tools like Looker, BigQuery efficiently manages both structured and semi-structured data. Empowered by additional AI tools from Google Cloud Platform, we can unleash the potential for transformative applications, including predictive analytics, website chatbots, and efficient methods to attract new customers. Join me as we explore these concepts in our upcoming project.

## Project OverView
In this project, I delved into the analysis of Google Analytics data extracted from the Google Merchandise Store, a real-time ecommerce website. Leveraging Jupyter Notebook, I seamlessly integrated this data with Google BigQuery, capitalizing on the scalability of BigQuery and harnessing the advantages of Python. The project is now complete, meticulously compartmentalized into various subtopics, offering a comprehensive exploration of the intersections between Google Analytics, real-time ecommerce, and BigQuery's robust capabilities.

### Conversion Analytics
[Conversion Analytics](https://github.com/vijaybhaskar98/Google-analytics-/tree/main/Conversion%20analytics) In this specific subtopic, I focused on analyzing the customer journey, tracing their path from the initial visitor stage to the final conversion stage. Throughout this project, we gain valuable insights into visitor behavior across different mediums, shedding light on the origins and channels through which our visitors arrive. This exploration provides a comprehensive understanding of user engagement and enables strategic decision-making to enhance the overall customer experience.

### Multitouch attribution
[Multi touch attribution model](https://github.com/vijaybhaskar98/Google-analytics-/tree/1f950a9340c96e1c3e0a039d07dfcb5a693204e3/Multi%20touch%20attribution%20modeling%20with%20google%20analytics%20%20data) Credit attribution models provide crucial insights into the effectiveness of different channels. These insights empower strategic decisions, enabling cost efficiency, informed investment decisions, and enhancing channel interactions for a more customer-friendly approach.

In this notebook, I've explored various attribution models, including first-touch, last-touch, linear-touch models, and delved into the probabilistic nature of the Markov model. While the Markov model exhibits high efficiency, it's important to note that no model is 100% secure. The choice of the model depends on specific requirements and objectives.
This exploration offers a glimpse into the world of credit attribution models, shedding light on their role in shaping impactful decisions. üöÄüí°

### Exploratory Data Analytics with Google Merchandise Store
